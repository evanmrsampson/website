        I'm Evan, a 23-year-old software dev based in Maine. I have curly hair and two middle names. I love playing video games, being mediocre at skateboarding, being decent at guitar, and being pretty good at programming. I don't love lobster or snow, both of which Maine is known for. In order to escape my mortal coil and ascend into the techno-sphere, I made a website. I wanted a place to host blog posts about software projects, game projects, and whatever else I decide to write. Thanks for stoppin' by!
