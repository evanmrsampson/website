    <p>
        I'm Evan, a full-time software dev and part-time game dev, based in southern Maine. My marketable interests include (but are not limited to): software engineering, game design, music composition, and 2D art. I also love skateboarding, anime, beer, and fashion, but lack any clue as to making them marketable.
        Anyway, in order to escape my mortal coil and ascend into the techno-sphere, I made a website. I wanted a place to host blog posts about software projects, game projects, and whatever else I decide to write. Thanks for stoppin' by!

        I do freelance web dev for my friends, but I'm open to doing it for strangers! If you want to talk shop, or just chat about anything I listed above, my DMs on Twitter are open. Alternatively, if you want to be real business-like, send me a message on LinkedIn.
